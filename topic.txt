Gary Morley and Paul Carpenter have asked if we can support them in testing pulling kafka consumer metrics into the PoC Kafka cluster so that they can test whether logic monitor can read and parse the metrics we are pushing to the Kafka consumer monitoring topic. The process for populating that topic is out of scope for now, but we want to prove the existing data can be parsed.

Work Involved

Implement a python script to act as a kafka consumer and kafka producer to move messages betwene prod/poc Kafka clusters for a given topic
