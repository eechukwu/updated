I passed my CKAD exam on Tuesday and also got news that I will be starting at FanDuel on Monday. It was really a good week.
It was kind of a mixed week. I rolled out from one FanDuel project on Wednesday and was told on Friday that I will be joining another one soon. So, it was a good weekâ€”100% better than staying on the bench.
