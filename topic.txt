I came across this GHA feature today that I was not aware of https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/skipping-workflow-runs
It might we worth trying it in the Anthos deployment resuable workflow as additional protection from triggering recursive workflows (the bit where it commits the image tag back to the repo).  Adding that should help with some concurrency issues we've seen with Argo sync workflow as well.

Problem:
Users can't reach dev-rt-b2b-giftcard-api because they're seeing a message saying "This page isn't working at the momentdev-rt-b2b-giftcard-api.anthos.sportski.com redirected you too many times. Try deleting your cookies. ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS."

Work:

Check how the Ingress and services are set up for dev-rt-b2b-giftcard-api to find why there are too many redirects.
Look at the app's code and server settings to make sure they handle requests and redirects correctly.
Use tools like curl and ping to test connections to dev-rt-b2b-giftcard-api and see if there are any issues.
Check the app's repository to make sure there are no configuration errors causing the redirects.
Test different situations to see when the issue happens and why.
Make changes needed to stop the excessive redirects and let users access dev-rt-b2b-giftcard-api smoothly.
Testing:

Make sure users can reach dev-rt-b2b-giftcard-api without getting the redirect error.
Check that the app works as it should after fixing the redirects.
Test on different browsers and devices to make sure it works everywhere.
Keep an eye on logs and user feedback to know if the issue is fixed.
