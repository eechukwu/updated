Here is my update for today:

	•	I will be working on the following clusters that are maxing out their vCPU capacity:
	•	Prod Warehouse
	•	Prod Retail
	•	Non-Prod Retail
	•	I will check all the apps’ vCPU requests/utilisation and contact the team that owns each app before making any changes. If I need to increase any of the Prod ones, then I will have to submit a change request for that as well.
	•	Work on the CronJob Alerting ticket on my board.
	•	F5: is still blocked; I will get in touch with the Network team about that.

Morning team,

My system is about to restart for an update. I will join the standup once it’s completed.
