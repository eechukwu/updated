The purpose of this document is to outline the permitted and prohibited tasks when using the Kubernetes JumpBox. This ensures proper usage and prevents any unintended changes or disruptions in the cluster.

Allowed Tasks:

Building New Cluster

Anthos K8S Cluster Upgrade

Generate Backup for GCP Support

Prohibited Tasks:

Run Kubectl Commands: Avoid running any kubectl commands directly from the JumpBox. This restriction is in place to prevent unintended changes or disruptions in the cluster, which could impact its stability and performance.

Install Unapproved Software: Do not install any software or packages on the JumpBox that have not been approved.

Make Configuration Changes:  Avoid making any configuration changes to the JumpBox or cluster components without proper authorisation.

Access Sensitive Data: Do not use the JumpBox to access sensitive data directly unless absolutely necessary and authorised

Do Not Run kubectl delete Commands: Never run kubectl delete commands from the JumpBox. This is critical to prevent accidental deletion of resources, which could lead to significant disruptions and data loss.
