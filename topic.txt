Good Morning All,

Following the successful update of the F5 CRD on the Non-Prod Clusters last week, we will be proceeding with updating the health checks on F5 for all Non-Prod applications today.

Please be assured that these changes will not impact any of the current workloads running on the clusters, as we are merely adding the health checks to the F5 configuration.

This update has been thoroughly tested in the Non-Prod Tech Enablement Cluster and has performed without any issues. For now, the update will be implemented exclusively on the NON-PROD CLUSTERS.

Here is the list of applications that will be affected:
