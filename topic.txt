Problem Statement
Our Kubernetes environment(s) are evolving, we have lots of different components for lots of different solutions and its getting a bit out of control.

We need to build a working document which will form a high level view of what tool/configuration we have for what environment and why. WE can also include where we are, and our desired state.

Examples of things to cover:

Secret Management solutions, what we have deployed where, and why, what our desired state is and why

External Secrets? ,why?

Ingress

F5?

Istio, where and why?

Image Repositories, why we are moving away from current one

For DR purposes our Image pull secret approach right now is a big risk

Our retention policy within GitHub is causing us issues

We need GAR and Harbour, put the reasons why

Policy Controller Policies, we havenâ€™t got CIS policies in place yet but we really should, we have image repo policies deployed.

General Statements such as Naming Conventions, Daily, Weekly, Monthly checks

Auto Scaling, what is our approach, where is htis used?

SSL Rotation & DNS

Document how this is currently done

Desired state is onboarding process for applications will auto register SSL/DNS and ssl rotation will be handled by a job updating the F5 certs in the repo
