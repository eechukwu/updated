Google Monitoring is part of our monitoring toolkit here at Frasers. It helps our teams keep an eye on all the apps running on our Anthos clusters. It provides tools to track how your applications are performing and alerts you if something goes wrong. Additionally, we use GCP dashboards to view important metrics.

At Frasers, we use PagerDuty to keep track of problems and on-call alerts. It helps us quickly spot and fix IT issues, making sure our team can respond fast and keep everything running smoothly. PagerDuty also makes it easier for us to stay in touch and manage these incidents, keeping everyone informed as things happen.
