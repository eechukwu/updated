Hi Luke, I wasn’t able to get this sorted today. Could you please pick it up on Monday? Matthew informed me that I can’t deploy after 4 pm and no deployments are allowed on Fridays.


I created some subtasks under the main ticket, breaking them down per cluster. There is one subtask for each of the clusters.
