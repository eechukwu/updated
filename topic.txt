Could you please confirm the following details:

What is the full meaning of "ED Group"?
Do they already have an active AD group?
I will need to update the details below with this information once you provide it.

Thank you.

    buying_viewer = {
      ad = "FG-Global-AAD-GCP-GKE-Buying-SecretViewer@frasers.group"
      role = "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
      prefix = "bd"
    },
    buying_editor = {
      ad = "FG-Global-AAD-GCP-GKE-Buying-SecretEditor@frasers.group"
      role = "roles/secretmanager.secretVersionAdder"
      prefix = "bd"
    },
    buying_editor_view = {
      ad = "FG-Global-AAD-GCP-GKE-Buying-SecretEditor@frasers.group"
      role = "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
      prefix = "bd"
    },
