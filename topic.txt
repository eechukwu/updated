Morning All,

I’ve updated the daily check scripts with new functionality:

	•	check_cpu_capacity.py: Calculates total vCPU usage against allocated vCPUs.
	•	check_memory_capacity.py: Calculates total memory usage against allocated memory.
	•	job_check.py: Loops through all clusters and displays pending pods.

The original cluster_check.py script is now split into two:

	•	cluster_check.py: Displays cluster-specific information.
	•	application_check.py: Displays application-specific information.

I’ll be uploading these updated scripts to GitHub shortly. Thanks.
