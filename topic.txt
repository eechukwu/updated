Unfortunately, we have to scale the warehouse Non Prod Cluster by adding extra nodes to it. We have a lot of applications currently running on the cluster. I have reviewed it with Rob and we both agreed to scale the cluster for now. I need to have a quick chat with you on this at some point today or tomorrow
