Hi Everyone,

During our routine daily check, we noticed that we have run out of vCPUs on the Non-Prod Warehouse Cluster. As a result, you wonâ€™t be able to deploy new applications into that cluster. To resolve this issue, I will be increasing the number of worker nodes in the cluster to four to accommodate new applications.

We expect no downtime for existing applications currently running on the cluster and will update the team once the process is completed.
