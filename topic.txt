### Best Practices for Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk as an Orchestration Platform for Capacity Provisioning

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a powerful orchestration platform that simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling web applications. At xDesign, we advise our customers to follow these best practices to fully leverage Elastic Beanstalk’s capabilities for capacity provisioning.

#### Capacity Provisioning

Effective capacity provisioning in Elastic Beanstalk involves the strategic allocation of compute resources to meet the demands of your application. This ensures optimal performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency.

**Best Practices:**

- **Choosing the Right EC2 Instance Size:**
  - **Start Small:** Begin with t2.micro instances for minimal initial traffic. As demand grows, scale up to larger instances like m5.large. This approach allows for a cost-effective start with the flexibility to scale as needed.
  - **Match Instance Type to Workload:** 
    - **Compute-Optimised (C5, C6):** Use these for compute-heavy applications that require high-performance processors.
    - **Memory-Optimised (R4, R5, X1):** Ideal for data-intensive and in-memory applications that require significant memory.
    - **Storage-Optimised (I3, D2):** Suitable for applications with large storage I/O requirements.

- **Leverage Auto-Scaling:**
  - **Auto-Scaling Based on Metrics:** Configure auto-scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on metrics like CPU utilisation, network traffic, or custom metrics. This ensures that your application has sufficient resources during traffic spikes and cost optimisation during low demand.
  - **Scale Out:** Set a scale-out policy with metrics such as CPU utilisation, specifying a threshold (e.g., 80%) and an action (e.g., add one instance). Elastic Beanstalk monitors these metrics and launches instances when the threshold is exceeded.
  - **Scale In:** Define a scale-in policy with metrics like network traffic, specifying a threshold (e.g., 2 MB/second) and an action (e.g., remove one instance). Elastic Beanstalk terminates instances when the metric drops below the threshold. Adjust thresholds, metrics, and actions based on your application’s needs.
  - **Memory-Based Scaling:** Configure auto-scaling policies based on memory utilisation, which is ideal for memory-intensive applications. For example, set a policy to add instances when average memory utilisation exceeds a specified threshold.
  - **Disk I/O-Based Scaling:** Scale instances based on disk read/write operations or disk queue length metrics, which is beneficial for applications with heavy disk I/O requirements.
  - **Application-Specific Metrics:** Customise auto-scaling based on application-level metrics such as active user sessions or queue lengths. Define custom metrics published by your application to trigger auto-scaling events, allowing scaling based on application-level indicators.
  - **Target Tracking Scaling:** Utilise target tracking scaling policies to automatically adjust capacity to maintain specific metric values, ensuring efficient resource utilisation. For example, maintain CPU utilisation around 50%.
  - **Scheduled Scaling:** Employ scheduled scaling to define recurring schedules for increasing or decreasing capacity based on anticipated traffic patterns.

**Example:**

For startups, start with cost-effective t2.micro instances and use auto-scaling to transition to m5.large instances as your user base and processing needs grow. This approach supports growth without downtime while ensuring you only pay for the capacity you need.

By selecting the right instance types and utilising Elastic Beanstalk’s auto-scaling features, you can optimise capacity provisioning, maintain performance, and control costs as your application scales.

#### Monitoring and Adjustments

Regular monitoring and adjustments are essential to maintain optimal capacity provisioning.

**Best Practices:**

- **Monitoring:** Use AWS CloudWatch to track key performance metrics such as CPU utilisation, memory usage, and network traffic. Regularly review these metrics to understand your resource utilisation patterns.
- **Adjustments:** Based on monitoring insights, adjust instance types, sizes, and scaling policies to optimise performance and cost. For example, if CPU utilisation consistently exceeds 80%, consider upgrading to a higher instance type or increasing the number of instances.

**Environment Health Monitoring:**

- **Environment Health Dashboard:** Utilise the Environment Health Dashboard to monitor the overall health of your environment, including instance health and request statistics. This helps in identifying and addressing capacity-related issues proactively.
- **Logs and Metrics:** Integrate with Amazon CloudWatch to provide detailed logs and metrics, enabling proactive monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Alarms and Notifications:** Configure CloudWatch alarms to notify you of any changes in the environment’s health or performance metrics. This enables timely intervention and resolution.

By following these best practices for capacity provisioning in AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you can ensure that your applications are highly available, performant, and cost-efficient. Effective capacity provisioning is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and reliability, enabling your applications to scale seamlessly in response to varying demand.
