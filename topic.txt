During the cluster bootstrap phase, we encountered an issue where the config-management/config sync refused to install correctly. After debugging the issue, we found out that the debug script automatically installed the latest version (1.17), which for some reason is not compatible with our bootstrap script. So we had to manually set the version to 1.16, which is exactly the same version used by other clusters as well.
