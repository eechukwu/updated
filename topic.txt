When building out the initial round of apps we used the following request values:

CPU: 250m

Mem: 256M



In testing - it was found that the services used very little CPU and these request values left the clusters looking artificially ‘full’

We should set the requests to cpu 100m in all base kustomize files to ensure best utilisation of hardware.



BUT PLEASE CHECK EACH SERVICES UTILISATION  FIRST TO MAKE SURE DROPPING THIS WONT CAUSE AN ISSUE
