### Ticket Title:
Add an Extra Node to Warehouse Cluster

### Problem Statement:
Add an extra node to the warehouse cluster because we have currently run out of CPUs on it.

### Work Involved:
1. Provision a new node with the required specifications.
2. Add the new node to the warehouse Kubernetes cluster.
3. Configure the node to match the cluster's existing settings.
4. Verify that the new node is properly integrated into the cluster.

### Test Criteria:
1. Ensure the new node is recognized and functional within the cluster.
2. Verify that workloads are successfully distributed to the new node.
3. Monitor CPU usage to confirm that the additional node alleviates the CPU shortage.

### Dependencies:
1. Access to the infrastructure to provision a new node.
2. Permissions to modify the Kubernetes cluster configuration.
3. Ensure the new node meets the necessary hardware and software requirements.
