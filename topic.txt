### Conclusion
- **Cost-effective options:** e2-micro, e2-small, and e2-medium are cheaper alternatives with more vCPU but different memory configurations.
- **Performance upgrade options:** e2-standard and e2-highmem types provide higher performance with more vCPUs and memory but at a higher cost.
- **Specific needs:** Choose based on whether you need more memory (e.g., e2-highmem) or more balanced configurations (e.g., e2-standard).

This should help you decide on the best E2 instance type for your needs. Let me know if you need any further details!
