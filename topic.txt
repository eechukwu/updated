Hello Emmanuel, 

I spoke with a GKE & Anthos Subject Matter Expert (SME) and we think will resolve the issue.


 


Next Steps:


Kindly update level to Level in the configMap file.


Once the update is done, please do a rollout restart of any associated stackdriver workloads.


Then check again in logs explorer to see if the application log entries show the appropriate severity.



I look forward to your response.
