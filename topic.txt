Examples of things to cover:

Secret Management solutions, what we have deployed where, and why, what our desired state is and why

External Secrets? ,why?

Ingress

F5?

Istio, where and why?

Image Repositories, why we are moving away from current one

For DR purposes our Image pull secret approach right now is a big risk

Our retention policy within GitHub is causing us issues

We need GAR and Harbour, put the reasons why

Policy Controller Policies, we havenâ€™t got CIS policies in place yet but we really should, we have image repo policies deployed.

General Statements such as Naming Conventions, Daily, Weekly, Monthly checks

Auto Scaling, what is our approach, where is htis used?

SSL Rotation & DNS

Document how this is currently done

Desired state is onboarding process for applications will auto register SSL/DNS and ssl rotation will be handled by a job updating the F5 certs in the repo

Image / Infra scanning

Currently a hole, we were looking at Snyk, and now infosec are wanting us to look at XMCyber (TODO)

Process required for managing base images if they need an update we need a workflow to automatically trigger a re-deploy based on a newer base image in the docker file. Rob/Ciaran started a process on this.
