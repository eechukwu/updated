Work Involved
Investigate pros cons of using spot VMs.  What are potential savings?  How long does it take for a replacement node to be created?  Whats the availability of spot VMs.  Is there any risk of all nodes being preempted?  Should be have a mix of allocated and spot VMs?  Should we just try it?
