We need improved monitoring and alerting for cluster resource issues to prevent bottlenecks and resource shortages, especially in monitoring total CPU usage versus available CPUs during application deployments.

Work Involved:

Implement monitoring tools and dashboards to track resource usage across clusters.

Write a script that will pull up the total CPUâ€™s usage from the clusters

Set up alerts for high resource usage, potential bottlenecks, and other critical metrics.

Test the new monitoring setup to ensure accurate tracking and alerting.

Test Criteria:

Monitoring tools should accurately reflect resource usage.

Alerts should be generated for high resource usage and potential issues.

Dependencies:
