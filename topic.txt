Certainly! Here's the updated version for the prod-warehouse cluster including raising a change request:

### Cluster: prod-warehouse

**Title: Adjust CPU and Memory Requests for prod-warehouse Cluster**

**Problem Statement:**
The current CPU and memory request values for services in the `prod-warehouse` cluster are set to 250m and 256Mi, respectively. During testing, it was found that these services use very little CPU and memory, leading to clusters appearing inaccurately resource-constrained.

**Work involved:**
- Review the CPU and memory utilisation for each service in the `prod-warehouse` cluster to ensure that lowering the requests will not cause any issues.
- Update the CPU request values in all base kustomize files for the `prod-warehouse` cluster from 250m to 100m.
- Update the memory request values in all base kustomize files for the `prod-warehouse` cluster from 256Mi to 128Mi.
- Raise a change request to implement the updates in the production environment, ensuring all stakeholders are informed and approvals are obtained.

**Test Criteria:**
- Monitor the CPU and memory utilisation of each service after updating the request values.
- Ensure that the services operate within acceptable utilisation limits and do not experience performance issues.

**Dependencies:**
- Access to the current utilisation metrics for all services in the `prod-warehouse` cluster.
- Collaboration with the DevOps and development teams to verify and approve changes.
- Approval of the change request by relevant stakeholders.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All services in the `prod-warehouse` cluster have their CPU request values updated to 100m and memory request values updated to 128Mi in the base kustomize files.
- No performance issues are observed in the services after the request values are updated.
- The cluster shows a more accurate utilisation of resources.
- The change request is successfully implemented and closed.

This version includes the additional step of raising a change request to ensure the updates are properly documented and approved before implementation.
