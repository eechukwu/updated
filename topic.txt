Hello Ademola,

Thank you for your prompt response.

I have reviewed the file you mentioned. Should I change every occurrence of "level" to "Level" in that file?

Additionally, for some reason, I am unable to see the images you attached. Could you please reattach them?

Finally, will this value be overwritten when we upgrade our Anthos to the next version?

Thank you.

Best regards,  
Emmanuel
