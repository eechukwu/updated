"NGINX Ingress, when integrated with F5 networks, serves a strategic role by optimizing the management and control of both inbound and outbound traffic in Kubernetes environments.

Just like F5, this is gradually being rolled out with F5 (see the F5 section for details).

The network team decided to go with NGINX Ingress instead of Anthos Istio Ingress because:

There is a lack of detailed documentation/support for Anthos Istio Ingress.
NGINX Ingress is owned by F5.
Vendor Support: F5 officially supports NGINX Ingress, unlike Anthos Istio, which lacks support."
