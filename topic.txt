Good Morning All,

I can confirm that the CRD has been successfully upgraded on the Non-Prod Tech Enablement Cluster.
And I can also confirm that we now have the required variable in the updated CRD

minimumMonitors:
  anyOf:
  - type: integer
  - type: string
  x-kubernetes-int-or-string: true
  
Following up on the above as well, I have gone ahead and tested the new configuration with an internal test app on the tech_enablement cluster and i can confirm that it was successfully applied, below are the apps configuration: 

apiVersion: "cis.f5.com/v1"
kind: VirtualServer
metadata:
  name: test-te-internal-test-app-vs
  namespace: nginx-ingress
  labels:
    f5cr: "true"
spec:
  virtualServerAddress: 172.16.110.224
  host: test-te-internal-test-app.anthos.sportski.com
  # hostGroup: tech_enablement   # Allows to share IP with other Apps
  # tlsProfileName: test-te-internal-test-app-tls
  policyName: fg-bigip-bp-tcp-xff-policy
  pools:
  - name: nginx_ingress_tech_enablement_hg # Confirm with Paul or Rob
    path: /
    service: nginx-ingress-nginx-controller
    servicePort: 80
    minimumMonitors: 1
    monitor:
      name: "/Common/http"
      reference: "bigip"
      type: http
      interval: 10
      timeout: 31
      send: "GET /health HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: test-te-internal-test-app.anthos.sportski.com\r\nConnection: Close\r\n\r\n"
      recv: "Healthy"
	  

Output:

Following up on all the above, Here is a PR for the test App. 
Note: This is just a test app, The application will be tested internally on my local system. Hence why i have commented out the secret bit. Finally the application will be deleted once you the 
network team agrees that you are happy with the configuration. 

Feel free to get intouch if you have any question.
