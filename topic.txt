Hi Team,

I have a tricky issue here. For some reason, Jayâ€™s App is throwing an SSL certificate error. I have encrypted the certificates myself twice, but it is still failing. I understand that Timmy and Vaib have also done the same in the past without success.

Do you have any suggestions on what I should check next?

Thank you,
