Hi [Recipientâ€™s Name],

I need some guidance regarding this ticket. I was informed by the DevOps team that we do not have an AWS Dev Canada account, and instead, we use the awsdevelopment account.

Should I modify the code to deploy it into the awsdevelopment account, or is there another preferred approach you would recommend?
