SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):

SSL is used to secure data transmitted over the internet by encrypting the connection between a user's browser and the server.
It ensures data integrity, security, and privacy, helping protect against eavesdropping and tampering.
Current SSL State:

We manually generate SSL certificates via a bash script that only a few people can run.
Future SSL State:

The goal is for SSL certificates to be automatically generated during the application deployment process, and SSL rotation will be handled by a job updating the F5 certs in the repository.
DNS (Domain Name System):

DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing browsers to load internet resources by name rather than IP address.
It acts like a phonebook for the internet, making websites accessible through familiar names instead of numerical IP addresses.
Current DNS State:

We manually generate DNS records by submitting a request to the infrastructure team.
Future DNS State:

The plan is to provide developers with an input form where they can enter the required application information, and the DNS will be automatically generated immediately.
