FYI warehouse team will be reaching out to you for a small bit of support, they need help understanding if the version of their app deployed to kubernetes is the one which is in source control.
 
Think we may need to look to check which image version is being used, and what commit that is based on.


Problem Statement
During a recent cluster build (ecom premium prod) there was an issue with the installation of config sync.  The version installed was 1.17.x.  All other clusters have < 1.17 installed.  Although it installed fine, it failed to auth with the the anthos management repository using SSH keys.  Pinning the version to 1.16.0 fixed the issue.

Work Involved
Update the following workflows to pin the version of config-sync installed

te-anthos-non-prod-bootstrap

te-anthos-prod-bootstrap

ec-anthos-non-prod-bootstrap
