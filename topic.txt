Hi Everyone, 
We noticed some issues with deploying new applications to the non-prod-warehouse-cluster and to resolve this issue , I will be working on increasing the number of nodes on the cluster to accommodate new applications into the non-prod-ecom-internal-cluster.
 
We expect no down-time to existing applications currently running on the cluster and will update the team when the process is completed.
