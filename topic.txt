Auto-Scaling Based on Metrics
Elastic Beanstalk allows you to define auto-scaling policies that automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in your environment based on predefined metrics. This ensures that your application has sufficient resources to handle traffic spikes while also scaling down during periods of low demand to optimize costs.
Scale Out (Add Instances)
You can configure a scale-out policy to add more instances when certain thresholds are exceeded. For example:
Metric: Average CPU Utilization across instances
Threshold: 80%
Action: Add 1 instance
With this policy, Elastic Beanstalk will monitor the average CPU utilization across all instances in your environment. If the average CPU utilization exceeds 80%, it will automatically launch an additional EC2 instance to handle the increased load.
You can also use other metrics like network traffic, disk I/O, or custom application-specific metrics to trigger scale-out events.
Scale In (Remove Instances)
Similarly, you can define a scale-in policy to remove instances when demand decreases, ensuring you don't over-provision resources and incur unnecessary costs.
Metric: Average Network Traffic
Threshold: 2 MB/second
Action: Remove 1 instance
In this example, Elastic Beanstalk will monitor the average network traffic across all instances. If the average traffic drops below 2 MB/second, it will terminate one EC2 instance, as the remaining instances can handle the reduced load.
You can adjust the thresholds, metrics, and scaling actions based on your application's specific requirements and resource utilization patterns.

h2. Auto-Scaling Based on Metrics

Elastic Beanstalk allows defining auto-scaling policies to automatically adjust EC2 instance count based on metrics, ensuring sufficient resources during traffic spikes and cost optimization during low demand.

h3. Scale Out

* Configure scale-out policy with metric (e.g., CPU utilization), threshold (e.g., 80%), and action (e.g., add 1 instance).
* Elastic Beanstalk monitors the metric and launches instances when the threshold is exceeded.
* Other metrics like network traffic, disk I/O, or custom metrics can also trigger scale-out.

h3. Scale In

* Define scale-in policy with metric (e.g., network traffic), threshold (e.g., 2 MB/second), and action (e.g., remove 1 instance).
* Elastic Beanstalk terminates instances when the metric drops below the threshold.
* Adjust thresholds, metrics, and actions based on your application's needs.

By leveraging auto-scaling based on metrics, Elastic Beanstalk dynamically adjusts capacity to match demand, optimizing performance and cost-effectiveness without manual intervention.

This should display the content neatly in Confluence with proper headings and bullet points.
