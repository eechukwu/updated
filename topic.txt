What NGINX Ingress is Used For:
NGINX Ingress is used as a controller in Kubernetes to manage access to services from outside the Kubernetes cluster. It directs incoming traffic to the right services based on the rules defined in the ingress resource.

Two Advantages of NGINX Ingress:

Performance: NGINX is known for its high performance and efficiency. It handles large volumes of traffic smoothly and is very fast.
Flexibility: NGINX Ingress allows detailed configuration options. You can fine-tune the behavior of your ingress traffic extensively, which is great for specific needs.
Two Disadvantages of NGINX Ingress:

Complex Configuration: While its flexibility is an advantage, it also means that NGINX can be complex to configure correctly, especially for users who are not familiar with its setup and syntax.
Limited Native Support for Advanced Traffic Routing: NGINX Ingress primarily focuses on basic load balancing and doesnâ€™t natively support advanced traffic management features like canary releases or A/B testing unless integrated with additional tools.
