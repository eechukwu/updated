Hi Ken, with mid year reviews coming could you please give me some feedback?
How would you rate the quality of my work and contributions to the FanDuel project?
Excellent
Good
Average
Needs Improvement
What were the strengths of my performance during the project?
In what areas do you think I could improve in future projects?

Hiya 👋


To prepare for mid-year reviews - I'm just asking for some constructive feedback about my work with you, any feedback that you could give me about my delivery/leadership over the past few months would be greatly appreciated. 🙏


Here are a few prompts if they help shape the feedback:


• What is one thing I can start or stop doing to be more effective in my role?


• On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate my ability to communicate, collaborate & lead?


Thanks,
Matt
