Title: Update of F5 CRD to Version 2.15 on Prod Cluster

Requestor: [Your Name]

Date: [Today’s Date]

Affected Systems: Prod Cluster

Priority: High

Description of Change:

Good morning Craig Teeder and Melinda Kaszoni,

I am proposing an update to the F5 CRD on the Prod Cluster. This update is necessary to address a request from our network team for improved health checks as part of the rollout of the F5 ingress across our clusters. Our current F5 version does not support these enhancements, and thus, we need to upgrade to version 2.15 of the F5 ingress CRD.

Reason for Change:

As we initiated the rollout of the F5 ingress across our clusters, the network team identified the need for better health checks. However, our current F5 version does not support the required parameters for these health checks. After extensive discussions with F5, it has been determined that an update to version 2.15 of the F5 ingress CRD is necessary to enable this feature.

Impact Analysis:

	•	Affected Systems: Prod Cluster
	•	Impact on Current Workloads: None. This change will not affect any of the current workloads running on the cluster.
	•	Downtime Required: None. The deployment will not require any downtime.

Change Implementation Plan:

	1.	Obtain change approval from the necessary stakeholders.
	2.	Schedule the update to be performed during off-peak hours to minimize any potential risk.
	3.	Manually update the F5 ingress CRD to version 2.15 on the Prod Cluster.
	4.	Monitor the update process and perform necessary checks to ensure the health checks are functioning as expected.
	5.	Communicate the completion of the update to all stakeholders.

Rollback Plan:

In the unlikely event that the update causes issues, the following rollback plan will be executed:

	1.	Revert the F5 ingress CRD to the previous version.
	2.	Verify that the system is functioning as expected.
	3.	Communicate the rollback to all stakeholders.

Approval:

This change request requires approval from the following stakeholders before implementation:
