I need to have your advice on this, we are running API for transactions submission to SD_LQM database.
It has requested RAM: 1Gi, CPU 2, Limited RAM 2Gi and CPU 4. 
CPU utilization is fine but for RAM it reaching on requested 40% and limited to 20% approximately. 
Branches that using API are 292, 917
Regions 2, 3, 12, 99
According to logs it's 30%, would you suggest to raise the RAM for the full transition?
