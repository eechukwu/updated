### Cluster Capacity Check
As part of our daily checks, it's important to monitor the CPU and memory usage of our clusters. To do this, simply run the `check_cpu_capacity.py` and `check_memory_capacity.py` scripts. These scripts will give you a clear picture of the current resource utilization, helping us ensure that the clusters are operating efficiently and have enough capacity to handle the workload. See some sample output below.

### Checked for Pending or Failed Cron Jobs
Another crucial part of our daily routine is to monitor for any pending or failed cron jobs. This can be done by running the `job_check.py` script. By regularly checking for failed or stuck jobs, we can quickly address any issues and maintain the smooth operation of our scheduled tasks. See some sample output below.
