Auto-Scaling Based on Metrics
Elastic Beanstalk allows you to define auto-scaling policies that automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in your environment based on predefined metrics. This ensures that your application has sufficient resources to handle traffic spikes while also scaling down during periods of low demand to optimize costs.
Scale Out (Add Instances)
You can configure a scale-out policy to add more instances when certain thresholds are exceeded. For example:
Metric: Average CPU Utilization across instances
Threshold: 80%
Action: Add 1 instance
With this policy, Elastic Beanstalk will monitor the average CPU utilization across all instances in your environment. If the average CPU utilization exceeds 80%, it will automatically launch an additional EC2 instance to handle the increased load.
You can also use other metrics like network traffic, disk I/O, or custom application-specific metrics to trigger scale-out events.
Scale In (Remove Instances)
Similarly, you can define a scale-in policy to remove instances when demand decreases, ensuring you don't over-provision resources and incur unnecessary costs.
Metric: Average Network Traffic
Threshold: 2 MB/second
Action: Remove 1 instance
In this example, Elastic Beanstalk will monitor the average network traffic across all instances. If the average traffic drops below 2 MB/second, it will terminate one EC2 instance, as the remaining instances can handle the reduced load.
You can adjust the thresholds, metrics, and scaling actions based on your application's specific requirements and resource utilization patterns.
