Purpose of HPA in Kubernetes:

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically adjusts the number of pods in a Kubernetes deployment based on observed CPU utilization or other specified metrics. Its primary purpose is to optimize the application performance and resource usage by scaling out (adding more pods) when demand increases and scaling in (removing pods) when demand decreases.
Current State:

HPA is currently configured on the eCom Clusters via a YAML file. See the linked document for more details.
Future State:

We need to decide if we will be rolling out this feature to the internal clusters because, at the moment, it is not running on any of the clusters.
