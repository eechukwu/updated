Good Morning Dan,

My focus for today will be on the following tasks:

	•	A guy from the eCommerce team named Ben Maher reached out to me regarding help with Google Data Store (Terraform). I am currently looking into that because we have a meeting scheduled for this afternoon.
	•	eCommerce on-prem meeting with the rest of the K8S admin team.
	•	Call with Timmy to work on some sample apps (TE internal app) with him, to get him used to the manifest file and also prepare the communications for that task.
	•	Call with Vaib to implement the GCP recommendations on the TE Non-Prod Cluster and hand over that ticket to him as well.
	•	Call with Rob and Vaib to discuss the ongoing F5 task and our progress on it.
