Good morning to you both,

I will be updating the F5 CRD that is currently running on the Non-Prod Tech Enablement Cluster. The main reason for this update is that as we started the rollout of the F5 ingress to our clusters, our network team requested better health checks be added to the F5 ingress configuration. Unfortunately, our current version doesnâ€™t support the required parameters.

Please note that these changes won't affect any of the current workloads running on the cluster. This update will only be implemented on the Non-Prod Tech Enablement Cluster.
