### Ticket: Addressing vCPU Capacity Issues in Clusters

#### Problem Statement:
The following clusters are currently maxing out their vCPU capacity:
- Prod Warehouse
- Prod Retail
- Non-Prod Retail

There is a need to assess and adjust the vCPU requests and utilization for applications running in these clusters to ensure optimal performance and resource allocation.

#### Work Involved:
- Created a Python script to compare vCPU requests/utilization.
- Identify and list all applications running in the specified clusters.
- Review vCPU requests and utilization for all applications.
- Contact application owners before making changes.
- Adjust vCPU allocations as needed.
- Submit change requests for Prod vCPU increases.

#### Test Criteria:
- Reduced vCPU utilization in some applications.
- No performance issues post-adjustment.
- Approved change requests for Prod clusters.

#### Dependencies:
- Approval from application owners.
