Hi Melinda,

I’m reaching out because I noticed that the app-name is currently syncing to your dev branch and it’s failing. Is there a particular reason why this app is syncing to your dev branch? I have checked the app repository but I can't find any dev branch on it. Am I okay to switch the app to sync with the main branch?
