External-secrets automates integrating external secrets into Kubernetes, enabling secure generation and access of secrets from GCP Secrets Manager, simplifying sensitive information management in Kubernetes.


Config-management
Simplifies how we manage configurations across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

(expand to include our use case e.g. Sync common RBAC roles like admin across clusters and policy controller policies)


SealedSecrets
Encrypts secrets to enhance the security of our sensitive information in Kubernetes.  

(expand to say it that it allows secrets to be stored in repo in an encrypted form)


ArgoWorkflows
Manages complex job sequences, improving how we handle automation tasks.  

(too generic - used in tandom with ArgoEvents to trigger jobs)


ArgoEvents
Enables our systems to react automatically to a wide range of events. (pods, deployments etc)

(too generic - what do we use it for e.g. Allowing Jobs to be triggered via events such as http post)
