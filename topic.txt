The grammar in your message is mostly correct, but there are a few minor adjustments that could improve clarity. Here's a revised version:

"Good Morning All,

I can confirm that the CRD has been successfully upgraded on the Non-Prod Tech Enablement Cluster. Additionally, I can confirm that we now have the required variable in the updated CRD:

```yaml
minimumMonitors:
  anyOf:
  - type: integer
  - type: string
  x-kubernetes-int-or-string: true
```

Following up on the above, I have gone ahead and tested the new configuration with an internal test app on the tech_enablement cluster, and I can confirm that it was successfully applied. Below are the app's configurations:

```yaml
apiVersion: "cis.f5.com/v1"
kind: VirtualServer
metadata:
  name: test-te-internal-test-app-vs
  namespace: nginx-ingress
  labels:
    f5cr: "true"
spec:
  virtualServerAddress: 172.16.110.224
  host: test-te-internal-test-app.anthos.sportski.com
  # hostGroup: tech_enablement   # Allows sharing IP with other Apps
  # tlsProfileName: test-te-internal-test-app-tls
  policyName: fg-bigip-bp-tcp-xff-policy
  pools:
  - name: nginx_ingress_tech_enablement_hg # Confirm with Paul or Rob
    path: /
    service: nginx-ingress-nginx-controller
    servicePort: 80
    minimumMonitors: 1
    monitor:
      name: "/Common/http"
      reference: "bigip"
      type: http
      interval: 10
      timeout: 31
      send: "GET /health HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: test-te-internal-test-app.anthos.sportski.com\r\nConnection: Close\r\n\r\n"
      recv: "Healthy"
```

Output:

```
ubuntu@non-prod-gke-admin-ws-230210-132552:~$ kubectl apply -f  f5test1.yaml

Following up on all the above, here is a PR for the test App. Note: This is just a test app. The application will be tested internally on my local system, which is why I have commented out the secret part. Finally, the application will be deleted once the network team agrees that they are happy with the configuration.

Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions."
