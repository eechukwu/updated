Here is the updated example to block all `Ingress` and `Gateway` resources except for `external-ingress`:

```yaml
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sBlockAllIngressAndGateway
metadata:
  name: block-all-ingress-and-gateway
spec:
  enforcementAction: dryrun
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
        kinds: ["Ingress"]
      - apiGroups: ["gateway.networking.k8s.io"]
        kinds: ["Gateway"]
    namespaces:
      - "*"
  parameters:
    allowList:
      - "external-ingress"
```

### Explanation:
- **enforcementAction: dryrun**: This setting ensures that the policy will not enforce the rule but will log violations for review.
- **match**: This section defines which resources are in scope for this constraint. The `kinds` field specifies that it applies to resources of kind `Ingress` from the API group `networking.k8s.io` and kind `Gateway` from the API group `gateway.networking.k8s.io`. The `namespaces` field with a value of `"*"` indicates that this constraint applies to all namespaces.
- **parameters.allowList**: This list includes the names of `Ingress` resources that are exempt from this constraint. In this case, only `external-ingress` is allowed.

This policy will block the creation of any `Ingress` and `Gateway` resources in the cluster, except for those named `external-ingress`.
