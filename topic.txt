Problem Statement:
We need better monitoring and alerting for cluster resource issues to prevent potential bottlenecks and resource shortages during application deployments. Especially when it comes to monitoring the total CPU used vs Available CPU’s

Work Involved:

Implement monitoring tools and dashboards to track resource usage across clusters.

Write a script that will pull up the total CPU’s usage from the clusters

Set up alerts for high resource usage, potential bottlenecks, and other critical metrics.

Test the new monitoring setup to ensure accurate tracking and alerting.

Test Criteria:

Monitoring tools should accurately reflect resource usage.

Alerts should be generated for high resource usage and potential issues.

Dependencies:

N/A
