its fairly easy - set the hosts in site B for both vmware clusters in main mode so vmware evacuates the hosts
a few days before
then we can fail it back a few days after the work - no need to do anything on the day
yeah you maint mode a physical host - and it will snapshot the machines memory, pause it very briefly then move it to another host
without even restarting it
Find and sign in to your Slack workspace.
you will have to do that 1 by 1 for each of the 3 hosts in site B
the only annoyance is when you maint mode Site B Host 1, it might move everything to Site B Host 2
and you cant do much about that but once all 3 are done you are good
if you just pulled the plug on site B, it would start all the vms up from cold on site A
