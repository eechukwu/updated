Our Kubernetes environment(s) are evolving, we have lots of different components for lots of different solutions and its getting a bit out of control.

We need to build a working document which will form a high level view of what tool/configuration we have for what environment and why. WE can also include where we are, and our desired state.

Examples of things to cover:

Secret Management solutions, what we have deployed where, and why, what our desired state is and why

Ingress

Image Repositories, why we are moving away from current one

Policy Controller Policies, we havenâ€™t got CIS policies in place yet but we really should, we have image repo policies deployed.

General Statements such as Naming Conventions, Daily, Weekly, Monthly checks

Work Involved
Build out this high level document with a grid which shows each component, information about where its deployed to and current state, and most importantly the desired state. We can also put a field to link out to any JIra Epics/Initiatives which show progression towards us getting to that goal.

This document will form the basis of regular conversations about whether we are moving towards where we need to be.
