Problem Statement:

Scheduled disk maintenance for Unit B requires putting all physical hosts in Site B into maintenance mode to ensure smooth VM evacuation and service continuity for our K8S Clusters.

Work Involved:

Notify Cluster Key Contacts about the maintenance schedule.

Set up a meeting with the Infra team to discuss the maintenance plan and assign tasks.

Sequentially put the 3 physical hosts in Site B into maintenance mode:

Site B Host 1

Site B Host 2

Site B Host 3

Ensure VMware evacuates VMs smoothly.

Take the hosts out of maintenance mode in reverse order:

Site B Host 3

Site B Host 2

Site B Host 1

Verify all systems and VMs are operational.

Test Criteria:

Successful VM evacuation.

Maintenance completed without service interruption.

All systems and VMs operational post-maintenance.

No service disruptions during and after maintenance.

Dependencies:

Infra team
