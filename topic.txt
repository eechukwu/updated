Status: Completed

I am writing to confirm that the migration was successfully completed on 18/06/2024. The process started at 1:30 AM and was concluded by 5:30 AM.

Upon completion, I verified all our applications in ArgoCD to ensure they were running smoothly. I also executed the daily check script, as outlined in our guide, to confirm that all clusters are in a healthy state.

Additionally, I checked vCenter and can confirm that all VMs moved during the migration have been successfully relocated back to their designated hosts.
