I am pleased to inform you that we have successfully updated the F5 CRD on all the production clusters.

Thank you for your support.


Hi Mate,

Do you have any updates regarding the VPN access? I have successfully migrated User Created over. The next step will be removing User Created from Meex, and I need VPN access for that in order to work with devstacks.

Thank you.
