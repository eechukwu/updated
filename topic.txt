### PRPAS-001 - Elastic Beanstalk: WIP

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a powerful orchestration platform that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of web applications. At xDesign, we help our customers fully leverage AWS Elastic Beanstalk to streamline their application deployments. Our approach focuses on optimising performance through capacity provisioning, enhancing scalability by implementing auto-scaling and load balancing, and ensuring robust application health monitoring. Below are our top recommendations for deploying this PaaS tool effectively.

### Capacity Provisioning

Effective capacity provisioning in Elastic Beanstalk involves strategically allocating compute resources to meet application demands, ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency.

**Best Practices:**

**Choosing the Right EC2 Instance Size:**
- **Start Small:** Begin with t2.micro instances for minimal initial traffic. Scale up to larger instances like m5.large as demand grows.
- **Match Instance Type to Workload:**
  - **Compute-Optimised (C5, C6):** For compute-heavy applications.
  - **Memory-Optimised (R4, R5, X1):** For data-intensive and in-memory applications.
  - **Storage-Optimised (I3, D2):** For applications with large storage I/O requirements.

**Leverage Auto-Scaling:**
- **Auto-Scaling Based on Metrics:** Configure auto-scaling to adjust the number of EC2 instances based on metrics like CPU utilisation, network traffic, or custom metrics.
- **Scale Out:** Set a scale-out policy with metrics such as CPU utilisation, specifying a threshold (e.g., 80%) and an action (e.g., add one instance).
- **Scale In:** Define a scale-in policy with metrics like network traffic, specifying a threshold (e.g., 2 MB/second) and an action (e.g., remove one instance).
- **Memory-Based Scaling:** Configure auto-scaling policies based on memory utilisation, ideal for memory-intensive applications.
- **Disk I/O-Based Scaling:** Scale instances based on disk read/write operations or disk queue length metrics.
- **Application-Specific Metrics:** Customise auto-scaling based on metrics such as active user sessions or queue lengths.
- **Target Tracking Scaling:** Utilise target tracking scaling policies to maintain specific metric values, ensuring efficient resource utilisation.
- **Scheduled Scaling:** Define schedules for anticipated traffic patterns.

**Example:**
Start with cost-effective t2.micro instances and use auto-scaling to transition to m5.large instances as your user base and processing needs grow. This supports growth without downtime while ensuring you only pay for the capacity you need.

By selecting the right instance types and utilising Elastic Beanstalk’s auto-scaling features, you can optimise capacity provisioning, maintain performance, and control costs as your application scales.

### Load Balancing in Elastic Beanstalk

Load balancing distributes incoming application traffic across multiple instances, preventing any single instance from becoming a bottleneck and ensuring that applications remain responsive and reliable. Effective load balancing is crucial for ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and optimal performance.

**Best Practices:**

**Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):**

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Ideal for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, provides advanced routing features such as host-based and path-based routing.
- **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Suitable for applications requiring ultra-low latency and high throughput, typically used for TCP/UDP traffic.
- **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** Legacy option for simple load balancing of HTTP/HTTPS and TCP traffic.

**Health Checks:**
- **Configure Health Checks:** Set up health checks to monitor the health of your instances. Elastic Beanstalk automatically removes unhealthy instances from the load balancer.
- **Health Check Paths:** Define appropriate health check paths that accurately reflect the health of your application, such as a specific endpoint that returns a 200 OK status if the application is healthy.

**SSL/TLS Termination:**
- **Enable SSL/TLS:** Use SSL/TLS termination at the load balancer to encrypt traffic between clients and the load balancer. This enhances security without burdening individual instances.
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):** Use ACM to manage SSL/TLS certificates easily, simplifying certificate provisioning, renewal, and deployment.

**Cross-Zone Load Balancing:**
- **Enable Cross-Zone Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic evenly across instances in multiple availability zones to improve fault tolerance.

**Sticky Sessions:**
- **Session Persistence:** Configure sticky sessions if your application requires that a user’s session is consistently served by the same instance.
- **Considerations for Sticky Sessions:** Use sticky sessions judiciously, as they can lead to uneven load distribution if not managed properly.

**Scaling and Load Balancing:**
- **Auto-Scaling Integration:** Integrate auto-scaling with your load balancer to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on traffic patterns.
- **Scaling Policies:** Define scaling policies based on load balancer metrics such as request count per target or average latency.

**Monitoring and Logging:**
- **Monitor Load Balancer Metrics:** Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor load balancer metrics such as request count, error rates, and latency. Set up alarms to notify you of anomalies.
- **Enable Access Logs:** Enable load balancer access logs to capture detailed information about each request, useful for troubleshooting and analysing traffic patterns.

**Example Configuration:**

Here’s how to configure load balancing for a web application in Elastic Beanstalk:

- **Choose Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Select ALB when creating your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
- **Configure Health Checks:** Define the health check path (e.g., `/health`) and set the health check interval and threshold.
- **Enable SSL/TLS Termination:** Use ACM to provision an SSL/TLS certificate and configure your ALB to use this certificate for HTTPS traffic.
- **Enable Cross-Zone Load Balancing:** Ensure cross-zone load balancing is enabled to distribute traffic evenly across all instances.
- **Define Scaling Policies:** Set up auto-scaling based on load balancer metrics, such as scaling out when the request count per target exceeds a certain threshold.

### Monitoring in Elastic Beanstalk: Recommendations by xDesign

### Heroku as an Alternative to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Heroku is a popular PaaS alternative to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It offers a streamlined developer experience and is known for its simplicity and ease of use. Here are reasons why an organisation might choose Heroku over Elastic Beanstalk:

- **Ease of Use:** Heroku's user-friendly interface and simplified deployment process can be more appealing for small teams or startups with limited DevOps expertise.
- **Integrated Services:** Heroku offers a wide range of add-ons and integrated services, making it easier to extend application functionality without managing external dependencies.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Heroku is ideal for rapid development and prototyping, allowing developers to quickly deploy and iterate on applications.

However, for larger scale or enterprise applications, Elastic Beanstalk provides more robust and scalable options that integrate deeply with the broader AWS ecosystem.
