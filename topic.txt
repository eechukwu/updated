Alternatives to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Heroku as an Alternative to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Heroku is a popular PaaS alternative to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It offers a streamlined developer experience and is known for its simplicity and ease of use. Here are reasons why an organization might choose Heroku over Elastic Beanstalk:

Ease of Use: Heroku's user-friendly interface and simplified deployment process can be more appealing for small teams or startups with limited DevOps expertise.
Integrated Services: Heroku offers a wide range of add-ons and integrated services, making it easier to extend application functionality without managing external dependencies.
Rapid Prototyping: Heroku is ideal for rapid development and prototyping, allowing developers to quickly deploy and iterate on applications.
However, for larger scale or enterprise applications, Elastic Beanstalk provides more robust and scalable options that integrate deeply with the broader AWS ecosystem.
